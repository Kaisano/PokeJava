# PokeJava
PokeJava Project by: Alex Lee (alee76@gmu.edu) <br>

Instructions for this project: run the Run.java file. When the java program is launched, a window titled "Login" will appear. To begin account creation, please click "New Login". During this process, you will need to create a new username and password which will be used to save player data. <br><br>
Once an account has been created and the user has logged in via the main Login screen, the user will be switched to the main game. In the game, the arrow keys are used to control the character in the middle. Be careful while walking around as wild pokemon might hop out in tall grass. A battle will begin by chance in the grass and you will need to fight to victory.<br><br>
Feel like you need a break? Press escape to open the menu. There are two buttons, one for saving the game and the other to exit the game. The next time you login, you will pickup right where you left off. Although, be careful! If you don't save your game before exiting, the data will be lost forever!<br><br>
Assets used in the program are owned by Nintendo and Gamefreak, and only for personal use. This program is <b>not</b> monetized and never will.  <br>
Features that weren't implemented: encryption, seperate map creation software, title menu
